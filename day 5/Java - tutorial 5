//Day 5 Loops

Unlabeled Break
You may recall break; from our previous discussion of Switch Statements. It will break you out of a loop even if the loop's termination condition still holds true. 

do{
    // this will execute once
    // it will execute again each time while(condition) is true
} while(condition);


int min = 0;
int max = 4;
while(min < max){
    System.out.println(min++);
}
