The remainder at each step of division is a single digit of the binary equivalent of ; if you then read each remainder in order from the last remainder to the first (demonstrated below), you have the entire binary number.
For example: . After performing the steps outlined in the above paragraph, the remainders form  (the binary equivalent of ) when read from the bottom up:
 
 
This can be expressed in pseudocode as:
while(n > 0):
    remainder = n%2;
    n = n/2;
    Insert remainder to front of a list or push onto a stack
